## Multi-Framework JavaScript To-do App
This repository serves as a demonstration of a simple To-do application implemented using various JavaScript frameworks. The project currently has three separate implementations:

## Vanilla App
* Located in the vanilla-app directory, this version uses fundamental principles of JavaScript without relying on any external frameworks. It provides a clear representation of a minimalistic To-do application, running on a live server.

## React App
* This implementation leverages React components, state management, and the virtual DOM to create an interactive user interface. It highlights the power and simplicity of building applications with React.

## Angular App
* The angular-app directory contains the To-do app built with the Angular framework. This implementation showcases the use of Angular components, services, and data binding to enhance the To-do application.
* Run using ```ng serve``` and accessing the local host via http://localhost:3000 to interact with the To-do app.

## Getting Started
To run any of the applications locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-frameworks.git``` (replace with your username)
2. Move to the vanilla directory: ```cd vanilla-app```
3. Run the To-do app via live server
4. Navigate to the desired framework directory: ```cd react-app``` or ```cd angular-app```
5. Install dependencies: ``` npm install ```
8. Run the app: ``` npm start ```
9. Open your browser and visit the local host to interact with the application
