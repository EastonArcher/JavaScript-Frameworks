## Multi-Framework ToDo App Showcase
This repository serves as a demonstration of a simple ToDo application implemented using JavaScript frameworks. The project currently encompasses three separate implementations:

## Vanilla App
* Located in the vanilla-app directory, this version showcases the fundamental principles of JavaScript development without relying on any external frameworks. It provides a clear representation of a minimalistic ToDo application, running on a live server.

## React App
* Within the react-app directory, the ToDo app is reimagined using React. This implementation leverages React components, state management, and the virtual DOM to create an interactive user interface. It highlights the power and simplicity of building applications with React.

## Angular App
* The angular-app directory contains the ToDo app built with the Angular framework. Angular provides a comprehensive structure for scalable and maintainable applications. This implementation showcases the use of Angular components, services, and data binding to enhance the ToDo application.
* Run using ng serve and accessing the local host via http://localhost:3000 to interact with the ToDo app.

## Getting Started
To run any of the applications locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-frameworks.git
2. Move to the vanilla directory: cd vanilla-app
3. Run the ToDo app via live server
4. Navigate to the desired framework directory: cd react-app or cd angular-app
5. Install dependencies: npm install
6. Run the app: npm start
7. Open your browser and visit the local host to interact with the application
