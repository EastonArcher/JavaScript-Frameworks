## Multi-Framework ToDo App Showcase

*This repository serves as a demonstration of a simple ToDo application implemented using distinct JavaScript frameworks. The project encompasses three separate implementations:

## Vanilla App

Located in the vanilla-app directory, this version showcases the fundamental principles of JavaScript development without relying on any external frameworks. It provides a clear representation of a minimalistic ToDo application, running on a live server.

## React App

Within the react-app directory, the ToDo app is reimagined using React and its ecosystem. This implementation leverages React components, state management, and the virtual DOM to create an interactive user interface. It highlights the power and simplicity of building applications with React.

## Angular App

The angular-app directory contains the ToDo app built with the Angular framework. Angular provides a comprehensive structure for scalable and maintainable applications. This implementation showcases the use of Angular components, services, and data binding to enhance the ToDo application.

## Getting Started

To run any of the applications locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-frameworks.git
2. Navigate to the desired framework directory: cd vanilla-app or cd react-app or cd angular-app
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Run the app: npm start
5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to interact with the ToDo app.
